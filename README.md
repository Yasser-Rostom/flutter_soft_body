🚀 Exciting Project Announcement: Simulating Soft Bodies in Flutter! 🤖

Hey LinkedIn community! 👋

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on - a soft body simulation implemented entirely in Flutter, without any external physics or game engine! 📱💡

Inspired by Gonkee's fantastic video explaining the physics and formulas behind soft body simulations, I decided to dive into the world of mass-spring models and bring it to life in Flutter. 🌟

🎥 You can watch the video that inspired me here: [YouTube Video Link]

📂 And here's the link to my GitHub repository where you can check out the code and experiment with the simulation yourself: [GitHub Repository Link]

Here are some key features of the project:

✨ Accumulation of Forces: I've incorporated gravity, spring forces (following Hooke's Law), and more to create a dynamic and realistic soft body.

🚀 Velocity and Position Updates: The simulation continuously updates the velocity and position of each mass point to ensure smooth and lifelike movement.

🌐 Collision Detection: I've implemented ray casting for collision detection, allowing the soft body to interact with its environment realistically.

👨‍💻 This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share it with the Flutter and developer communities. I hope it serves as a source of inspiration and education for fellow tech enthusiasts and developers.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or simply enjoy the mesmerizing motion of soft bodies! 🌌

Thank you for your support, and don't forget to like, share, and subscribe to stay updated on more exciting projects in the future. 🚀👨‍💻
